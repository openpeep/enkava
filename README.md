    Fast, Lightweight üëå JSON Content Rules Language, Validator and Generator<br>
    ü¶ú It says what you say, if you say so (WIP)
</p>

## üòç Key Features
- [x] Lightweight & Multi-threading
- [x] Parrot as a `Language` or simple `seq[string]`
- [x] Intuitive & Easy to Learn
- [ ] Generate rules by `JSON` sample | Say what you say ability
- [x] Extension as `.parrot`
- [x] Open Source | `MIT` License

## Installing
```
nimble install parrot
```

## Examples

Minimal example, using Parrot with rules wrapped in a `seq[string]`:

```nim
let example = %*{
    "name": "Trippy Parrot",
    "year": "2022",
    "shopping": [
        "Bananas", "Whatever Juice", "Soda", "Cat food", true
    ]
}

var p = Parrot.init(example,
    rules = @[
        "name*:string",
        "version*:int",
        "url*:string",
        "shopping*:array[5, string]"
    ])

# Check for errors.
if p.hasErrors:
    for e in p.getErrors(asString = true):
        # Set `asString` true for full line in a single string,
        # or remove it and returns a tuple[line, field, expectType, givenType, givenValue: string]
        # for creating your own error message
        echo e

```

Of course, `seq[string]` is no more related when talking about handling big documents with complex rules.

Now, let's see the real power of **Parrot Language**.

# Define your rules for friends. Which is a `required` array
# that can contain only objects, 100 maximum
#
# With Parrot abilities you can simply use same ^ pointer
# followed by a previously declared object and done. 
friends*: array[100, object]                # array of 100 objects, maximum
    ^profile                                # Dont Repeat Yourself

posts: array[object]

### üëë Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
